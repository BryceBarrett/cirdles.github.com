The following is a very basic walkthrough of some of Topsoil’s features. For more detailed information on importing data into Topsoil, see <a href="#importing">How to Import Data</a>.

1.	Open Topsoil. An about page will pop up, you will see a menu bar in the upper portion of the screen. In addition to this, you will see all of your recently opened Topsoil files populate the right hand portion of your screen.

2.	From the menu bar, select File > Open Example > Uranium-Lead. This will populate Topsoil with some sample data from a Uranium-Lead analysis.

3.	Again in the menu bar, you will see "Visualizations". If you click this tab, you will be able to see a "Generate Plot" option. Click it!

4.	A separate window should have appeared, with the plot inside of it. There are a few drop-down menu's on the right side of the window. They contain all of the tools for you to use if you want to manipulate the graph. If you so choose, you could click on the "Data Options" drop-down menu and toggle off the “[Unct.](#unct) Ellipses” that are currently being displayed on the graph.

5.	There are many features of the graph that can be toggled on or off. Turn your attention to the "Plot Features" drop-down menu. Select the "Concordia Line" feature from the list and now you should see a Wetherill Concordia line displayed in your plot window.

6.	Click-and-drag and zoom inside of the plot until you get to a position you like. If you get too far away from the original view, click the “Reset View” button above the plot to re-center the view to the data. You could also click the "Snap to Corners" button to alter the view so that the Weitherill Concordia line begins and ends in each corner of the plot window. Please note that this feature will only work for the Wetherill Concordia line and not the Tera-Wasserburg Concordia line.

7.	Click the button “Export to SVG” or "Export to PDF", and save the file as something like “testPlot.svg” or "testPlot.

8.	Back in the main window, from the menu bar, select File > Save As. This option lets you save your current working state as a .topsoil file, so when you open this file again, your tables and plots will be automatically loaded.

9.	Save the project as something like “test.topsoil”.
